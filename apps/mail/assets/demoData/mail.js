Work on Projects with Claude

Read the blog post
Hello,

Claude Pro and Team users can now organize chats into Projects. Projects bring together internal knowledge and chat activity in one place so Claude can help you generate ideas, make strategic decisions, and deliver exceptional results.

With Projects, you can:
Upload docs and code—like style guides, codebases, or user feedback—so that every response you get from Claude is grounded in expertise about your Project.
Generate new content like code snippets or diagrams with Claude and see a preview of your Artifacts in a dedicated panel.
Share your most insightful Claude chats and the Artifacts you create on the Project activity feed, allowing your teammates to learn, explore, and build on shared content.
To get started, upgrade to the Pro plan or create a Team plan to collaborate with colleagues. To learn more, check out our blog post.

גל ינוקא
עדיין לא בוגרת וכבר יזמת

גל ינוקא, כשמה כן היא - האורחת הצעירה ביותר שלנו עד כה בפודקאסט.
היא סטודנטית פעילה, עדיין לא בוגרת, אבל כבר עכשיו, בגיל 28, רשמה סדרה של הישגים מאוד מרשימים: יחד עם ד"ר קרני אילן ושני קליין, גל יסדה את Feminai – סטארטאפ ייחודי המפתח טכנולוגיה חדשה לאבחון מוקדם של סרטן השד.
במקביל לעבודה על המיזם, גל היא הנדסאית אלקטרוניקה וסטודנטית שנה ד' להנדסה ביו־רפואית בטכניון.
נשמע ממנה על הפיתוח פורץ-הדרך של Feminai, על חלומה מגיל 16 להיות יזמת, על הבחירה בה ובשותפות שלה לרשימה היוקרתית של "פורבס", וגם על קבוצת "דולפין"… האזינו ותבינו 🙂

Better audio, lyrics, song structures, cover art—everything about v4 goes harder. Experience a constant stream of dopamine and creative satisfaction for only $10 a month. That’s less than the overpriced coffee you pretend to like, just so you can flirt with the barista.

    createdAt: 1730764800000,
    updatedAt: null,
    body: `
Polars GPU accelerated engine with NVIDIA RAPIDS is available in open beta
The new GPU accelerated engine for Polars DataFrames is available in open beta. With GPU-accelerated Polars, users can expect a performance boost up to 13x compared to Polars on CPU on compute-bound queries.



Get started by installing the GPU engine on eligible machines with:

pip install polars[gpu] -U --extra-index-url=https://pyi.nvidia.com

You can run your Polars workloads on your GPU by passing engine=”gpu” to the collect method. Operations that are not (yet) supported by the GPU engine will gracefully fallback to the default CPU engine.


Benchmarking GPU performance

PDS-H benchmark scale factor 80 | GPU: NVIDIA H100 PCIe | CPU: Intel Xeon W9-3495X (Sapphire Rapids) | Storage: Local NVMe. Note: PDS-H is derived from TPC-H but these results are not comparable to TPC-H results

Use cases that are computational heavy (joins, group bys, etc.) can see around 10X speed ups. I/O heavy queries see on average a 1-3X speed up.

Learn more and explore the impact on your use case
You can learn more about the design, technical implementation and find additional benchmarks in the release post on our website.

Read the full release post
If you are curious to start exploring GPU acceleration, we suggest to start with the documentation in the User Guide or one of the example notebooks:

    body: `Hi Google Cloud Support,

I’ve noticed some discrepancies in the billing statement for December 2024. Specifically:
- A charge for $350 labeled as "Unknown Instance Usage."
- An additional service fee I wasn't expecting.

Can you please provide a detailed breakdown of these charges? If they're incorrect, I’d appreciate assistance in resolving this.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
